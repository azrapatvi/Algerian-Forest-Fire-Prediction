# 🔥 Algerian Forest Fire Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the occurrence of forest fires in Algeria using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers the complete workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

The goal is to build a reliable classification model that can help in early fire risk detection and support preventive decision-making.
